Practice as part of TheOdinProject Google Homepage prototyping exercise.

Things to improve on:

1. Nesting CSS better (current implementation is very imprecise and breaks easily//not responsive)
2. Correct positioning of top navigation menu
3. Display "Search by voice" overlay when hovering over mic icon in search bar.
4. Omnibox should retain blue border once clicked inside, and until clicked outside.
5. Top Nav bar images to darken when hovered over (trivial but skipped)
